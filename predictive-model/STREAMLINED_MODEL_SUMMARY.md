# Streamlined Random Forest Model Summary

## Overview

This document presents the streamlined Random Forest model for *Leishmania* species classification, focusing exclusively on proteins that map uniquely to single genes. The model includes comprehensive stress testing to evaluate performance under different protein coverage scenarios.

## Key Features

### 1. Strict Gene Mapping
- **Unique Gene Filtering**: Only proteins with `Unique_Gene_Mapping == True`
- **Single Gene Validation**: Additional check to exclude proteins with multiple genes (separated by `;` or `|`)
- **Clean Dataset**: Ensures unambiguous gene-to-protein relationships

### 2. Streamlined Architecture
- **Single Algorithm**: Random Forest only (no model comparison)
- **Optimized Parameters**: 100 trees, max_depth=10
- **Feature Selection**: Optional top-k feature selection
- **Efficient Training**: Fast training and prediction

### 3. Comprehensive Stress Testing
- **Protein Coverage Testing**: Performance evaluation with 50-5000 proteins
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Simulates samples with limited protein detection
- **Accuracy Thresholds**: 90% and 95% accuracy benchmarks

## Model Performance

### Training Results
- **Dataset**: 50 samples (24 Lb, 11 Lg, 5 Ln, 10 Lp)
- **Features**: 8,144 proteins with unique single-gene mapping
- **Accuracy**: 100% (1.0000)
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified validation

### Stress Test Results

**Focused testing on critical protein coverage range (10-200 proteins) reveals exact performance thresholds:**

| Proteins | Accuracy | Standard Deviation | Success Rate ≥95% | Performance Level |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 10 | 0.8620 | ±0.1112 | 30.0% | **Poor** |
| 20 | 0.9500 | ±0.0700 | 60.0% | **Good** |
| 50 | 0.9940 | ±0.0237 | 94.0% | **Excellent** |
| 100 | 1.0000 | ±0.0000 | 100.0% | **Perfect** |
| 200 | 1.0000 | ±0.0000 | 100.0% | **Perfect** |

### Species-Specific Analysis

**Critical Discovery**: Different species require different numbers of proteins for optimal classification:

| Species | Sample Count | 10 Proteins | 20 Proteins | 50 Proteins | Classification Difficulty |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Lb** | 24 | 94.0% (76% ≥95%) | 98.4% (94% ≥95%) | 100.0% (100% ≥95%) | **Easiest** |
| **Ln** | 5 | 90.0% (90% ≥95%) | 98.0% (98% ≥95%) | 100.0% (100% ≥95%) | **Easy** |
| **Lp** | 10 | 82.0% (68% ≥95%) | 92.0% (84% ≥95%) | 98.0% (96% ≥95%) | **Moderate** |
| **Lg** | 11 | 69.0% (52% ≥95%) | 88.0% (76% ≥95%) | 99.0% (98% ≥95%) | **Hardest** |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Lg (L. guyanensis)** shows poorest performance with low protein coverage (69% with 10 proteins)
2. **Lb and Ln** maintain excellent performance even with minimal proteins (94% and 90% with 10 proteins)
3. **Lp** shows moderate difficulty, requiring 50+ proteins for optimal performance
4. **All species** achieve excellent performance (≥98%) with 50+ proteins

**Biological Implications:**
- **Lg** has the most similar protein expression patterns to other species
- **Lb and Ln** have the most distinctive protein signatures
- **Lp** shows intermediate characteristics
- **Sample size** doesn't correlate with classification difficulty
